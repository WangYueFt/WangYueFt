I am a Research Scientist at Nvidia Research, working with [Marco Pavone](https://web.stanford.edu/~pavone/). I graduated from MIT EECS, advised by [Justin Solomon](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon) at [Geometric Data Processing Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup). I was also fortunate to collaborate with [Michael Bronstein](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.bronstein) and [Phillip Isola](https://web.mit.edu/phillipi/). Previously, I was a master student at University of California, San Diego. Prior to that, I received my BEng in Computer Science from Zhejiang University.  I've received the [Nvidia Fellowship](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/graduate-fellowships/) (2020-2021) and the MIT EECS William A. Martin Masterâ€™s Thesis Award (2021).

My research lies in the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics. My goal is to use machine learning to <strong>enable robot intelligence with minimal human supervision</strong>. I study how to design 3D learning systems which leverage geometry, appearance, and any other cues that are naturally avaiable in sensory inputs. I am also broadly interested in eclectic applications on top of these systems.

Topics I currently focus on include:
* <strong>Geometric deep learning</strong>: [DGCNN](), [DCP](), [PRNet](), [Object DGCNN](), [PointGrow]()
* <strong>3D perception for robotics and autonomous driving</strong>: [PillarOD](), [Object DGCNN](), [DETR3D](), [HDMapNet]()
* <strong>2D/3D self-supervised learning and few-shot learning</strong>: [FeatureDecor](), [RFS](), [STAR](), [RepLearnPoint]()
* <strong>Neural representations</strong>
