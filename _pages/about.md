I am an Assistant Professor at [USC CS](https://www.cs.usc.edu) and a part-time Research Scientist at [NVIDIA Research](https://nvr-avg.github.io).

 <!-- I graduated from MIT EECS in 2022, advised by [Justin Solomon](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon) at [Geometric Data Processing Group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup). I was also fortunate to collaborate with [Michael Bronstein](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.bronstein) and [Phillip Isola](https://web.mit.edu/phillipi/). Previously, I was a master student at University of California, San Diego. Prior to that, I received my BEng in Computer Science from Zhejiang University.  I've received the [Nvidia Fellowship](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/graduate-fellowships/) (2020-2021) and the MIT EECS William A. Martin Masterâ€™s Thesis Award (2021).  -->

My research lies in the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics. My goal is to use machine learning to <strong>enable robotic intelligence with minimal human supervision</strong>. I study how to design 3D learning systems which leverage geometry, appearance, motion, and any other cues that are naturally available in sensory inputs. I am also broadly interested in fundamental deep learning tools and eclectic applications on top of these systems.

Topics I currently focus on include:
* <strong>Neural scene representations for autonomous driving and robotics</strong>: [EmerNeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02077), [FreeNeRF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07418)
* <strong>LLMs as agents for continuous decision making</strong>: [GPT-Driver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01415)
* <strong>Fundamentals of deep learning</strong>: 

Past topics: 
* <strong>Geometric deep learning</strong>: [DGCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07829), [DCP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.03304), [PRNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12240), [Object DGCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06923), [PointGrow](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.05591)
* <strong>3D perception for robotics and autonomous driving</strong>: [PillarOD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10323), [Object DGCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06923), [DETR3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06922), [HDMapNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06307)
* <strong>2D/3D self-supervised learning and few-shot learning</strong>: [FeatureDecor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00470), [RFS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11539), [STAR](https://openreview.net/forum?id=hW0tcXOJas2), [RepLearnPoint](https://openreview.net/forum?id=nuAGobCwb8V), [GeoMAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08808)
